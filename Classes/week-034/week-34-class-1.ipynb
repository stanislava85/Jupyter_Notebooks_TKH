Often, we are not aware of optimal values for hyperparameters which would generate the best model output. So, what we tell the model is to explore and select the optimal model architecture automatically. Hyperparameter tuning is the process of determining the right combination of hyperparameters that allows the model to maximize model performance. Setting the correct combination of hyperparameters is the only way to extract the maximum performance out of models."
