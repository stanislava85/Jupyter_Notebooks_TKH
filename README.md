PROGRAMS DETAILS
The Innovation Fellowship is a new and improved job training program that launched in September 2020. During technical instruction, fellows will be assigned coding problems to solve in pairs or individually. 
This class aims to take fellows from little to know programming experience to junior data scientists capable with using technology based in the Python programming language to pull useful and actionable information out of the sea of data that surrounds us everyday. In this class fellows will learn the full extent of the Python programming language, how to access, clean and analyze web data, and how to work directly with databases using both Python and SQL.
In this class fellows will be given real world tasks using actual data sets and learn to run analysis with Pythons major data analysis libraries to gain knowledge, and finally learning how to create online data dashboards to display your findings. This course will teach fellows these in demand skills through real world projects and code challenges in a supportive community environment.
